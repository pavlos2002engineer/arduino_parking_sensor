parking sensor

For this project I used an ultrasonic sensor HC-SR04, 6 LEDs (2 Greens, 2 Oranges and 2 reds), a piezo-electric buzzer, a LCD to dislpay the distance, step down buck converter 4-40V DC and 9V battery. I set the program, the closer the object is, the brighter the LEDs will turn on and the more frequently the buzzer will beep.
