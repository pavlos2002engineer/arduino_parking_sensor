parking sensor

For this project i used an ultrasonic sensor HC-SR04, 6 LEDs (2 Greens, 2 Oranges and 2 reds), a piezo-electric buzzer and a LCD to dislpay the distance. I set the program like, the closer the object is, the brighter the LEDs will turn on and the more frequently the buzzer will beep.
